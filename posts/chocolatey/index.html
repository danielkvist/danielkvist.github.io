<h2 id="5-years-using-linux">5 Years using Linux</h2>

<p>I started using Linux more than 5 years ago. In fact, my first distribution was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#1010">Ubuntu 10.10</a>. Ubuntu version on which Unity debuted for the first time (a GUI that I&rsquo;ll never forget, though that&rsquo;s another topic). But at that time I was still using Windows 7 along with Ubuntu. So I don&rsquo;t really consider it a jump.</p>

<p>It was a couple of years later when I decided to use only Linux. And the truth is, it was as good ad it was a bad idea.</p>

<p>At that time I learned a lot about how computers work, what programming really was and how I could get the most out of my computer. The bad part is that I learned all of that by force, quickly and usually badly. Luckily I was younger and had the energy to solve all the problems I was generating myself.</p>

<p>And step by step, with effort and constancy. I learned to really love Linux, the terminal and finally, the terminal again.</p>

<p>But then&hellip; why go back to Windows?</p>

<h2 id="coming-back-to-windows-10">Coming back to Windows 10</h2>

<p>There are many things that I really love about Linux, and there are also things that I just hate. But they&rsquo;re not the reason why I&rsquo;m back using Windows.</p>

<p>The real reason is simpler. I bought a new laptop that came with Windows 10 preinstalled (a rarity, I know). And I just decided to stick with it to see how everything had changed in all this time.</p>

<p>And the truth is that the experience is being extremely positive&hellip; except for a few details.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-miss">What I miss</h2>

<p>Basically, the most important thing to me is that the Windows shell is still üí©.</p>

<p>After that realization I remembered that new project that tries to solve it: the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal">Windows terminal</a>. And before I started using the always reliable shell that comes with Git I decided to take a look at it.</p>

<p>And while the truth is that the new Windows terminal has a lot to offer, but it&rsquo;s still a little green and I just haven&rsquo;t put in all the effort it might need to start enjoying it.</p>

<p>The important thing is that in the process of installing the new Windows terminal I discovered <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey: the package manager for Windows</a>.</p>

<h2 id="discovering-chocolatey">Discovering Chocolatey</h2>

<p>I had actually read things about Chocolatey before going back to Windows. I just haven&rsquo;t paid attention to it until now. And what a nice surprise.</p>

<h2 id="installing-chocolatey">Installing Chocolatey</h2>

<p>I could copy and paste everything the Chocolatey page says about installing it, but instead I&rsquo;d rather leave you a <a href="https://chocolatey.org/install">link</a>.</p>

<p>I really think the process is quite simple, the only thing you don&rsquo;t have to forget is to run the whole process in a shell with administrator permissions (not like me the first time&hellip; and well, maybe the also the second).</p>

<h2 id="using-chocolatey">Using Chocolatey</h2>

<p>You can use Chocolatey basically for what it is. Installing and managing software.</p>

<p>You can install <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/vim">vim</a> using it:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">choco install vim
</code></pre>

<p>Or <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/golang">Golang</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">choco install golang
</code></pre>

<p>And if you want to update something:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">choco upgrade golang
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>You have the list with all the commands available both in the CLI using the <code>--help</code> flag and in the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs">docs</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And for the moment, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
