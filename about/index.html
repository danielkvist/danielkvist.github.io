<h2 id="hello-there">Hello there</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this I guess it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve asked yourself the same question that I&rsquo;ve sometimes asked myself at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning: &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo;. And although the answer to such questions is always complicated, I will try to answer as simply as possible.</p>

<h2 id="who-i-am-now-right-now">Who I am now, right now</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m a 25-year-old boy who has decided that his next job is going to be as a developer. If possible, as a Junior Go Developer. The reason is simply because I love programming in Go.</p>

<h2 id="who-i-ve-been-and-what-i-ve-done-with-my-life-to-become-who-i-am-today">Who I&rsquo;ve been and what I&rsquo;ve done with my life to become who I am today</h2>

<p>My family has never had much money, so in my childhood I hardly had contact with a computer beyond what was academically necessary. So until the economic situation improved, I focused on other aspects that I was passionate about at the time: drawing and writing.</p>

<p>Perhaps that&rsquo;s why for when we could acquire a personal computer, the first thing I did with it was open and play with the paint and the second, install a pirate version of Adobe Photoshop. Eventually, as technology advanced, I moved on to 3D design and animation, discovering Blender along the way. And with Blender, I discovered Python.</p>

<p>My first steps with Python were not very productive, there was always something that didn&rsquo;t fit me. But I liked the idea of being able to program a computer. So instead of continuing with Python, I tried JavaScript. And everything was so much better. So good that I decided to learn how to develop web pages, learning along with JavaScript a lot of HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>I got to learn some Node.JS and Vue.js before meeting Docker. A technology that reminded me that I still had a lot to know about how computers worked, operating systems and how to be a better programmer. So for a while I stopped developing websites and started to learn Docker and, with it, Go.</p>

<p>And after two years, I feel like I did the right thing. Docker is one of my favourite tools and Go is undoubtedly the programming language I&rsquo;d like to work with from now on.</p>

<h2 id="just-code-how-boring">Just code? How boring</h2>

<p>The truth is, there are three things I&rsquo;m passionate about aside from programming. And they are: reading, playing the ukulele and sleeping.</p>

<p>If I have time, I also try to exercise and hang out with my friends. Things that I also consider important.</p>
