      <description>First things first This days I&amp;rsquo;m working on Botio. An opinionated CLI to build and manage bots and their commands for different platforms among which is Telegram. And it&amp;rsquo;s from working on Botio that this article comes from.
I would also like to warm you that the code below may seem at first glance too simple and therefore disappoint a little. If that&amp;rsquo;s your case, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. In this article I just want to lay the groundwork for future articles that (I hope) might interest you a bit more.</description>
