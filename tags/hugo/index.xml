      <description>Piercer is another theme for Hugo. Is very customizable and light and has been designed under the mobile-first philosophy. It offers support for PostCSS and, like the two previous topics, barely uses JavaScript.
Like Terrassa it also provides a contact form with support for Netlify forms.</description>

      <description>Terrassa is a popular theme for Hugo made to be responsive and accessible. It&amp;rsquo;s a very classic theme with a top navitation bar (menu that switches depending on the viewport size of the device), a hero with the option to add a CTA button, as many &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; sections as you want and, finally, a contact form that can be used with Netlify forms.</description>

      <description>Tania is a simple and clean theme for Hugo, the framework for building static websites. Even though it&amp;rsquo;s still on development you can see it working right here, as it is the current theme I am using for my webpage.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t use any CSS framework like Bootstrap or Bulma since the goal is to create a theme as light as possible. Only basics CSS properties like CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox.</description>
