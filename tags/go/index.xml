      <description>What is a Linked list Linked lists are one of the most simpler and basic data structures which are defined by the Wikipedia as follows:
 A Linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.</description>
