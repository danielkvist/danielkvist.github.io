      <description>5 Years using Linux I started using Linux more than 5 years ago. In fact, my first distribution was Ubuntu 10.10. Ubuntu version on which Unity debuted for the first time (a GUI that I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget, though that&amp;rsquo;s another topic). But at that time I was still using Windows 7 along with Ubuntu. So I don&amp;rsquo;t really consider it a jump.
It was a couple of years later when I decided to use only Linux.</description>
