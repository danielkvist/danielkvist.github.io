      <description>First things first This days I&amp;rsquo;m working on Botio. An opinionated CLI to build and manage bots and their commands for different platforms among which is Telegram. And it&amp;rsquo;s from working on Botio that this article comes from.
I would also like to warm you that the code below may seem at first glance too simple and therefore disappoint a little. If that&amp;rsquo;s your case, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. In this article I just want to lay the groundwork for future articles that (I hope) might interest you a bit more.</description>

      <description>First things first The idea behind this article comes from my experience building Kelsier, which idea itself comes from this article.
The code that I&amp;rsquo;m going to show below is very likely to have and will have aspects that can be improved. So please, if you see something you don&amp;rsquo;t think is entirely ideal or there&amp;rsquo;s something you know can be done in a better way, let me know by opening an issue in the repository of this site.</description>
