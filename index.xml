      <description>Hello there If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this I guess it&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;ve asked yourself the same question that I&amp;rsquo;ve sometimes asked myself at 3 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning: &amp;ldquo;Who am I?&amp;rdquo;. And although the answer to such questions is always complicated, I will try to answer as simply as possible.
Who I am now, right now I&amp;rsquo;m a 25-year-old boy who has decided that his next job is going to be as a developer.</description>
