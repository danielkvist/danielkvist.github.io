      <description>Projects Tania Tania is a simple and clean theme for Hugo, the framework for building static websites. Even though it&amp;rsquo;s still on development you can see it working right here, as it is the current theme I am using for my webpage.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t use any CSS framework like Bootstrap or Bulma since the goal is to create a theme as light as possible. Only basics CSS properties like CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox.</description>

      <description>Education As a self-taught developer most of my education is based on Moocs, online courses, books and tutorials.
Moocs I have successfully completed MOOCs such as CS50&amp;rsquo;s - Introduction to Computer Science and CS50&amp;rsquo;s - Web Programming with Python and JavaScript and audited others like W3Cx - Introduction to Web Accessibility or CS50&amp;rsquo;s - Mobile App Development with React Native. Mentioning only the most recents.
Courses I have taken courses on platforms such as freeCodeCamp, Pluralsight, Frontend Master or Udemy about subjects like modern JavaScript, React, Golang, TDD, gRPC, Microservices, PostgreSQL, API design and Docker.</description>
