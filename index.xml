      <description>What is a Doubly linked list Like Linked lists, Doubly linked lists are a very simple data structure whose definition from Wikipedia is:
 A Doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each Node contains three fields: two link fields (references to the previous and to the next Node in the sequence of nodes) and one data field.</description>

      <description>Who I am Well, the truth is, I&amp;rsquo;m a person who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like to repeat myself too much. So I&amp;rsquo;ll leave here the link to the page where I have already written about who I am.
What I am going to talk about I&amp;rsquo;m going to write about almost everything. But above all, about software development, Go and myself. I know it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound very interesting or very original. But well, I didn&amp;rsquo;t say it&amp;rsquo;s going to be either.</description>

      <description>Hello there If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this I guess it&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;ve asked yourself the same question that I&amp;rsquo;ve sometimes asked myself at 3 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning: &amp;ldquo;Who am I?&amp;rdquo;. And although the answer to such questions is always complicated, I will try to answer as simply as possible.
Who I am now, right now I&amp;rsquo;m a 25-year-old boy who has decided that his next job is going to be as a developer.</description>
